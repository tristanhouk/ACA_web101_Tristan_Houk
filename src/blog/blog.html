                Surgical Needle That Sucks Wine From Bottle Without Removing Cork

                        Wanting only a glass or two of wine puts drinkers in a tough spot. Once the bottle’s opened, the wine starts to oxidize and lose its flavor. No rubber stopper will halt the process, leaving partial bottles to go to waste. Greg Lambrecht, a medical-device entrepreneur, figured out a way to solve the problem. The devices that Lambrecht once built used a special needle to access implants without creating permanent punctures. His Coravin Wine Access System uses the same idea to draw wine from a bottle without uncorking it.

                        When Microsoft introduced the Kinect sensor in 2010, the company said the motion-capture system would transform gaming. That was only partially true; gamers could do novel things like swing an imaginary golf club or dance, but the Kinect wasn't sensitive enough to register intricate maneuvers. The system, however, has become most popular among hackers, who used it to build smart shopping carts and gesture-controlled quadrocopters. In November, the company will launch an upgraded Kinect with the Xbox One console. With that release, Microsoft could finally disrupt gaming at the level it had originally intended, changing not only how we interact with games but also how games interact with us.

                Koehler made a real fancy smart toilet with Alexa inside for some reason

                        Living rooms have always gotten a lot of love at CES with huge TVs and fun tech toys, but kitchens have been catching up lately with massive smart screens and connected appliances that somehow bring the internet into the process of microwaving a burrito. This year, however, it seems the bathroom is getting some special attention, and the key product so far is Kohler’s new smart toilet. The Numi has a customizable seat warmer, a built-in light show, and—of course—Alexa built in to control all the fancy functions. It reportedly costs roughly $7,000 or $9,000 if you want the black one so it’s underway only for the fanciest of butts.

                        On Tuesday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved an esketamine nasal spray for the treatment of depression. At first glance, the announcement seems like a big moment for the 30 to 40 percent of depressed Americans who haven’t responded to two or more conventional therapies. But the truth is a little more complicated.
